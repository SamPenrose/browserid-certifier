# A Keysigner Process for BrowserID

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lloyd/browserid-keysigner.png)](http://travis-ci.org/lloyd/browserid-keysigner)

This repository aims to build a process capable of signing keys for
BrowserID.  If you wanted to build a Primary Identity Authority with
BrowserID support, this is something you can run in your environment,
and talk to over HTTP to implement certificate generation.

A Work In Progress.
